      <p>If the book that you are looking for is a book that the library stock, you will notice three coloured dots next to the picture of the book. The different colours represent difference things:
        <ul>
          <li>The green circle tells you whether the book is available or not, and if there are multiple copies in the library, it shows how many of those copires are available to borrow.</li>
          <li>The red circle stands for reservations. If shows whether the book has been reserved and if so, how many times.</li>
          <li>The blue circle shows how many total copies of a book we have in the library.</li>

      <p>If you find that the library stocks a book that you are looking forward but it is currently on loan, you can reserve the book so that when it is returned, the librarian will put the book aside for you and contact you to inform you that the book is now available. Simply click on green 'Reserve' button at the top of the page.</p>

    <header>How to find books in the Library</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        We need to know how to find books in the library. There are two types of books: fiction books and non-fiction books. The fiction books are all fiction - not based on a true story/made-up. They are all downstairs and are organised by the surname of the author. For example, if you are looking for a book from the popular Harry Potter series, there will be a sticker on the book's spine with the first three letters of author J K Rowling's surname: ROW.
        Non-fiction books are all located upstairs, apart from the biographies and autobiographies. They are arranged according to something called the Dewey Decimal System.
